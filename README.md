This is a simple progressive web app which shows swimming spots in Sweden on an interactive map. Each loacation is provided with some usefull information such as description, photos, ratings and comments of visitors from each spot.

All data is gathered from [https://www.badkartan.se/](https://www.badkartan.se/) a website providing amazing information about swimming spots but unfortunately not in a mobile friendly layout.
